12973	UNKNOWN	It's 4 am and i've just realised that Calibraska is out tomorrow. Oh.
12974	UNKNOWN	I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh
12975	UNKNOWN	but today is one direction's 5th anniversary  sharknado 3 is coming and cory tweeted about sharknado and makes me wanna cry im so emotional
12976	UNKNOWN	#frugaladventure Sonic Drive In {$1 Hot Dogs}: Apparently July 23rd is National Hot Dog Day. If you are a fan ... http://t.co/vz4fzC7l8O
12977	UNKNOWN	Sharknado further proof we need the 2nd amendment.  For yoi Seneca students its the right to own a gun .
12978	UNKNOWN	I liked a @YouTube video from @mamexe http://t.co/5zowojmvuO Mike Tyson: Floyd Mayweather lost the fight in September 12
12979	UNKNOWN	I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
12980	UNKNOWN	All I did was look up "Kpop" and BTS was on the 3rd row.  This makes me feel proud ????
12981	UNKNOWN	@MC2000watts @MTV Evidently Kpop fans noticed it awhile ago-it may be too controversial to win now, Uptown Funk is a good choice for VOTY :)
12982	UNKNOWN	@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
12983	UNKNOWN	Thursday is National Hot Dog day! What would you like on yours?    Give us your ideas!
12984	UNKNOWN	Kaylee bet I wouldn't get my tweet on sharknado and she may be right
12985	UNKNOWN	@UsTheDuo seriously. If you two are still in Asheville on Friday, I work at Dunkin from 12-4. West Asheville. I make a mean Coolatta.
12986	UNKNOWN	Unscripted theater on FS2 and people are watching Sharknado. (Well, some of it may be scripted)
12987	UNKNOWN	Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
12988	UNKNOWN	#Sharknado3 April Lives Can't wait for Sharknado 4 begin the Hypenado!
12989	UNKNOWN	I'm convinced listening to the Freak Show tomorrow morning will be WAY better than that Sharknado ending. @fsmikey @FSBigBob
12990	UNKNOWN	So wait, Twitter decides if April lives or dies? It doesn't make sense... But then my husband reminded me this is Sharknado. #Sharknado3
12991	UNKNOWN	My kids look forward to the Sharknado movies, because they are awesomely horrible....and we need April! #AprilLives
12992	UNKNOWN	such a good ending to SHARKNADO 3!  YOU DECIDE BY TWITTER HASHTAG IF APRIL LIVES OR DIES!  the answer will be... http://t.co/9xIQwd7afq
12993	UNKNOWN	I hope Sharknado 4 starts with @mcuban saving April #AprilLives
12994	UNKNOWN	@Mightymorph G'nite Morph and God Save The Queen &amp; Princess Charlotte,, &amp; wish Prince George a happy birthday 4me when you see him tomorrow
12995	UNKNOWN	#AprilLives  No Sharknado without April.  Love a chick with a sawhand
12996	UNKNOWN	I don't care if April is dead or alive, I just can't wait for Sharknado 4
12997	UNKNOWN	@anuparno3 @IKalmeshh_ Eid festival have only 3 days n some ppl celebrate for 2 days Monday was a last day of Eid
12998	UNKNOWN	You'd think with as successful a franchise as Sharknado they could splurge a little on the crappy cgi for this 3rd installment.
12999	UNKNOWN	This #GOP race is seriously getting out of hand. Who in the blue heck is John Kasich? Or red heck, as the case may be here.

17528	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson is just a walking disaster on Sunday's lately.
17529	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson would be -13, tied for 5th if he simply bogeyed the first instead of puttin' up a snowman.

17547	UNKNOWN	Not often when you see Dustin Johnson going low on a Sunday
17548	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson makes an eagle on 16 to move to -13. He may not have a major, but boy is he wonderful to watch when on song. #USPGA
17549	UNKNOWN	What a joke of a scorecard by Dustin Johnson. -4 today with a quadruple bogey 8 on the par 4 1st.  2 eagles on the back 9. #PGAChampionship
17550	UNKNOWN	If Dustin Johnson had pared the 1st hole he'd be 17 under right now
17551	UNKNOWN	If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch
17552	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson's scorecard is ridiculous. Starts with a snowman on the 1st hole. Since then hes added 2 eagles and 4 birdies
17553	UNKNOWN	Brawler Martin Maulers came all the way from Prince George to get #lockedin for their 20th anniversary. Can they get out before their 21st?!

17555	UNKNOWN	I'll see Paper Towns tomorrow with some friends, can't wait
17556	UNKNOWN	Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st. Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits.
17557	UNKNOWN	#USPGA Man totally oblivious to Dustin Johnson's tee shot landing beside him at the 17th. #foreleft
17558	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson is -8 over the last 14 holes.  Oh for that quad on the 1st....
17559	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson and Sunday's just don't mesh well #PGAChampionship
17560	UNKNOWN	You may dislike Floyd Mayweather but he never took a loss like this.. http://t.co/lgM52cUMye
17561	UNKNOWN	I have no idea what to wear tomorrow to the Sam smith concert.. Need to go shopping but hate shopping. Ugh
17562	UNKNOWN	Why is Muhammad a myth.? If not then Muslims should welcome historians to do their job. I say they are afraid of what the historian may find
17563	UNKNOWN	Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey. An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy.
17564	UNKNOWN	Dear @paddypower any chance you can pay out 7th place on dustin johnson after his comeback today #justiceforjohnsonbackers
17565	UNKNOWN	@highoffHAZEE only thing that is guaranteed of tomorrow is the finishing off of any Christians left in the M.E...Hazel wallah you're giving

17567	UNKNOWN	I know it's just preseason but do I still get free Dunkin tomorrow, or nahhhh?
17568	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson straight dominating the majors on Thursday and Friday and folding on the weekend. #boogersugarftw
17569	UNKNOWN	Just your typical Sunday ...Spieth and Day there in the end, while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round
17570	UNKNOWN	Look for Carly Fiorina to take Donald Trump on - she may win - we shall see.
17571	UNKNOWN	What if Caitlyn Jenner is actually the worlds ultimate April Fools joke?
17572	UNKNOWN	Ryan Braun hit a grand slam and finished with five RBI in Sunday's 6-1 win over the Phillies.
17573	UNKNOWN	@ajhmate Yes!!!! Lol. I think Andy mentioned her on the July 12th show and Audrey actually mentioned him on Big Brother too lol. Loves him.
17574	UNKNOWN	Send me Lwanga's hw packet and I will buy you Dunkin tomorrow morning
17575	UNKNOWN	@JamesFenn90 Like you say, Rory, Spieth, Rose and Day should be great to watch. If Dustin Johnson can get his head together he may join them
17576	UNKNOWN	Dustin Johnson flies out of the blocks at every major, but he simply cannot get it right on a Sunday.
17577	UNKNOWN	I hope tomorrow is the last RAW where Seth Rollins is WWE champion for at least a year.

21328	UNKNOWN	Credit where it's due that is a good ball by Mason but I would say the ball is made by Kane's run. He'll score 2 in the 2nd half.
21329	UNKNOWN	@BrendanWadlow still see Koivu. You even admitted it was a good comparison like a month back. Kane may be a better one though.

25165	UNKNOWN	Murray with another huge 1st down run, 26 yds
25166	UNKNOWN	and the reason why they went with Murray, he went 26 yards on that run. Faked half the Sun Devils out of their jocks.

25168	UNKNOWN	Welp. White Sox dominating the #Royals. May be time to go back to the full strength lineup tomorrow.
25169	UNKNOWN	And ASU tackles Murray short of the 1st down for the first time

25171	UNKNOWN	@HibernianRetro @Fritz1875 The mic batteries are running out! Murray 3-1 up 2nd set with a break. Matchsticks needed for my eyes here!
25172	UNKNOWN	Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down. Murray and crew will go for it.
25173	UNKNOWN	Could the #Aggies get more conservative on offense? Would be hard. Turn it over on 4th-and-1 at ASU's 20, misusing Murray for second time.
25174	UNKNOWN	Don't forget to ask about your chance to go see Janet Jackson in Saskatoon on Monday. We've got tickets and they could be yours tonight!

26216	UNKNOWN	I'm afraid of Murray though... He beat Belluci with ease in the 3rd round. Kevin's strong point is his serves!
26217	UNKNOWN	Murray is so flat atm, if Anderson can get inspired at the start of the 2nd he can take control of this match.
26218	UNKNOWN	Rare i walk away from a match but big day tomorrow so i need my sleep. Shout loud Murray fans #BacktheBrits #USOpen
26219	UNKNOWN	"Gay marriage isn't the law." Yes, it is. It was interpreted by the SCOTUS as such in accordance with rights granted by the 14th Amendment.

26226	UNKNOWN	Not the easiest of shots, but Murray may end up really regretting hitting it long to fall down 0-2 in the 2nd set.
26227	UNKNOWN	Absolutely mortified and gutted that Sam Smith may be doing the new Bond song :(
26228	UNKNOWN	Haha I'm going to see Foo Fighters tomorrow Jesus Christ that's just hit me
26229	UNKNOWN	It may just be me focusing on the losses, but Murray's tie-break record seems shite in my head, in big games at least.
26230	UNKNOWN	Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen
26231	UNKNOWN	Not the best start to the 2nd set from Murray, but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players "look scruffy"
26232	UNKNOWN	Murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set. I'm not watching any more. He does my  head in at times doing everything the hard way!
26233	UNKNOWN	Murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying Murray at Evens? Ridiculous
26234	UNKNOWN	@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
26235	UNKNOWN	1 set up and has already broken Murray in the 2nd. This is beautiful from Kevin
26236	UNKNOWN	@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
26237	UNKNOWN	Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis

26243	UNKNOWN	Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
26244	UNKNOWN	Anderson's 1st serve goes off in that game but Murray cant take advantage. Anderson now leads 4-1 in the 2nd set #USOpen
26245	UNKNOWN	I counted five tight points from Anderson in that game, may have been more. Gets a slice of fortune with Murray netting the BH. Holds for 41
26246	UNKNOWN	@Michael_Fabiano Help! Should I trade Gore for Murray? I have Gore (I drafted him 4th round) but was offered Murray (went in the 1st round).
26247	UNKNOWN	Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd &amp; 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015
26248	UNKNOWN	Super super super excited about gay pride on the 19th too mf hype.
26249	UNKNOWN	If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.

26263	UNKNOWN	Of the 2 Milton Keynes setlists the Foo Fighters played this past weekend, the Saturday was definitely the better one. Glad I was there
26264	UNKNOWN	A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
26265	UNKNOWN	@notzeev IKR, gonna be me tomorrow night "Hi Costco, Naruto ready for work, believe it!"
26266	UNKNOWN	Murray down a set and losing 5-2 in the 2nd set to the 6'8 Anderson. Hard to beat the big hitters when they're serving at their best.
26267	UNKNOWN	Murray holds to 30 and now Anderson leads 5-3 in the 2nd set. Anderson will serve for the set for a 2nd time #USOpen
26268	UNKNOWN	Last two service games started well only to be whittled away at. Still, Murray wins second game on the trot to make it 3-5 in 2nd set.

26276	UNKNOWN	Finally, on the 5th attempt, Anderson wins the second set 6-3, serving his 12th ace for the match to lead 2 sets to love against Murray.
26277	UNKNOWN	Microphone picking up Murray's F bomb at the sit down after the 2nd set...
26278	UNKNOWN	4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. Anderson 2-0 sets. Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. He's not out yet!
26279	UNKNOWN	Camera closes in on Murray in his chair after losing 2nd set and he's dropping F bombs like they're going out of fashion. Brilliant. #USOpen
26280	UNKNOWN	I'm sure Murray will win the 3rd set but not sure if he would win the match.
26281	UNKNOWN	Murray two sets to love down. Think the broadcaster may want to turn the volume down, quiet a few F's coming from Murray! #USOpen2015

26293	UNKNOWN	@UltimateTennis_ he better close it in 3, not making much 1st serves and Murray seems winning all 2nd serves..important serve game to start?
26294	UNKNOWN	Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.
26295	UNKNOWN	Anderson survives a test, and now has 2 sets up on Murray. Can the Brit pull off a 2nd 0-2 set comeback?
26296	UNKNOWN	Murray on the verge of being Scottish again for the 2nd time in a week.......

26306	UNKNOWN	Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
26307	UNKNOWN	Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen

26324	UNKNOWN	Anderson is up 2 sets, but Murray is up a break in the 3rd set. It feels even-steven right now.
26325	UNKNOWN	@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)
26326	UNKNOWN	ESPN announces "We're going to be here for awhile tonight" -- Murray looks to run away with the 3rd set. up 3-1, with the serve.
26327	UNKNOWN	Murray is pissed here and in the march! Hope he pulls it off #USOpen
26328	UNKNOWN	Although it's hard to tell, since I only have radio commentary. May just be that Anderson is choking badly, not Murray playing better.
26329	UNKNOWN	Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen

27464	UNKNOWN	Lol, get a grip #royals fans. I can forgive the HRs, but he biffed that pitch to Thor and then fell apart in the 4th https://t.co/5vyHq69IQn
27465	UNKNOWN	Thor is cruising and we are hosed...see you all tomorrow at 2-1
27466	UNKNOWN	Grandy showing some real nixe range our there in RF, saving a 2-out double to end the top 5th. 12 straight retired by Thor. #NYMvsKC
27467	UNKNOWN	@ACMI 2nd visit to David Bowie Is last night and I already feel like I should be going again! Absolutely amazing exhibition! Thank you! &lt;3
27468	UNKNOWN	Yes, Thor, I remember those 6th inning stats of yours. Let's lose them tonight, hey? #LGM
27469	UNKNOWN	Away. Away. Away. Syndergaard peppering outside of the plate and then busts pitches inside. Thor has found his groove. 5K. Top 6th.
27470	UNKNOWN	I have an uneasy feeling..last 2 times I felt this way was day before the attitude article &amp; when Briana came to London..I may be wrong tho
27471	UNKNOWN	Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets
27472	UNKNOWN	Hate to admit it but Arod is good in the booth. Interrupted Harold talking about Thor costumes for the 8th time and provides real insight
27473	UNKNOWN	@hughcartoons he was like David Abbott's edgier younger brother.  the Elvis Costello to David Abbott's George Harrison, if i may.
27474	UNKNOWN	Thor just giving me my 16th heart attack of the night. It's okay, just some candy corn lodged in my valves this time. #LGM
27475	UNKNOWN	Rios grounds out to end the inning. Should be all for Thor with Colon and Neise on bullpen. Still 5-3 Mets in 6th.
27476	UNKNOWN	Finally home from all this so called shopping in time to see Thor Finish up the 6th
27477	UNKNOWN	Thor said Thursday during press conf that he had tricks up his sleeve for tonight. It was the Warthen slider, he relied on it heavily 3 IP+
27478	UNKNOWN	@MetsProspectHub there's no way Thor should start the 7th anyway
27479	UNKNOWN	Thursday is Thor's day and I'm sore from the thunder of stress that I'm under
27480	UNKNOWN	People who know baseball know Thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
27481	UNKNOWN	Harold Reynolds talking how the 1st pitch from Thor sent a message, sure if you forget the Royals he 6 hits in the first 2 innings
27482	UNKNOWN	Put it in the books! Big games for The Captain, Thor, and Granderson. Let's got Matz tomorrow! #LGM
27483	UNKNOWN	Nice win, Thor, Captain America, and the Falcon came up big , let's even this up tomorrow. #LetsGoMets
27484	UNKNOWN	The first one is always the hardest. Way to go Thor!! Looking to tie it up tomorrow night! #LGM #MetsTwitter https://t.co/LPnQoXri1a
27485	UNKNOWN	I knew Thor would get the job done. Matz on tomorrow, offense seems to be waking up, Let's Go Mets!!! #LGM
27486	UNKNOWN	Here we go boys!!! Great job by Thor tonight!!!! And the Captain!! Huge spot for the Long Island kid Matz tomorrow.
27487	UNKNOWN	What's nice about CY pitching tomorrow night, he won't lose focus like Ventura did after Thor singled. We can't go to a game 7 with YV
27488	UNKNOWN	Win tomorrow and we get another shot at a 3 game set with Harvery deGrom and Thor #WontHappenAgain
27489	UNKNOWN	@cyr Me. I am a Caitlin face tonight, but a Thor face tomorrow.
27490	UNKNOWN	I want to dress up as Thor tomorrow and wear a Syndergaard jersey.
27491	UNKNOWN	how about the balls on TC to stay with Thor with bases loaded to get that 3rd out!! #mets
27492	UNKNOWN	if YoVentura had done what @mets Thor did on the 1st pitch to Esky he would have been villainized. Instead, Thor is a hero. #GoRoyals
27493	UNKNOWN	@_mistermet @Buster_ESPN kinda hoping Matz pitches inside tomorrow, though he's a different pitcher than Thor
27494	UNKNOWN	I knew that Escobar attacks 1st pitches, so there you go, hit this one.. Thor is a real life hero. #LGM
27495	UNKNOWN	Thor is the man, this guy may have single handidly just turned this around with that first pitch
27496	UNKNOWN	I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
27497	UNKNOWN	@Lou_Pellegrino you must have heard thor's comments on the 1st pitch he's not afraid that much we know
27498	UNKNOWN	Thor is a throw back kind of pitcher. I love it!!!!  https://t.co/EAm51LNbHR
27499	UNKNOWN	I don't understand the narrative that Thor owned the game because of that first pitch. The Royals got to him in the 1st &amp;  2nd, right?
27500	UNKNOWN	Matz needs to come out firing  like Thor tomorrow  first pitch in the same place #Mets #MetsTwitter #MLB
27501	UNKNOWN	I don't know who but someone is partying with fat Thor tomorrow
27502	UNKNOWN	I'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby Royals about Thor's 1st pitch to Escobar. If I'm Matz, I'm doing the same thing Saturday.
27503	UNKNOWN	@TwinkleMets I just heard a quote that the Royals intend to get back at the Mets for the 1st pitch tonight Please tell Curtis to be careful!
27504	UNKNOWN	@dubs_mike80 If Escobar was hurt I would hope you would be calling for Thor's suspension. If KC throws up tomorrow, you should have no prob
27505	UNKNOWN	Curtis will see you Saturday #playoffs

27509	UNKNOWN	David Bowie may have tucked @MarkRonson into bed as a child--listen--bigtime players on the left did to Yours Truly too.
27510	UNKNOWN	@PIITP A normal hard slide into 2nd would be comparison to Thor pitching inside,Utley comparison would be if he actually hit him in the head
27511	UNKNOWN	@brianbuck13 no more than when Curtis or Murphy had to dive in the 1st 2 games.
27512	UNKNOWN	@lindacohn @BMonzoWFAN Thor's single with 2 strikes leading off the 3rd is what should tick them off.

27993	UNKNOWN	@FNocher It was at Place de la Nation on the day of the mass march after Charlie Hebdo shooting. I probably should have noted that.

29181	UNKNOWN	But ya...I'm just waiting for February so that Cole and Kendrick can drop their collabo album.
29182	UNKNOWN	This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him
29183	UNKNOWN	This day (26 Feb) in 1988 George Harrison received the award for "Video Of The Year" for "When We Was Fab".
29184	UNKNOWN	Can't wait for the picture of Kendrick holding 11 Grammys to surface so I can be like "this is for the people in March calling TPAB trash"

29196	UNKNOWN	Someone said that they might snub Kendrick on all 11 nominations or he may get just 1. If that happens then it's clearly rigged.
